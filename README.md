# Melanoma-Classification
Developed a model for skin cancer classification over 33126 melanoma and non-melanoma images using Python scientific packages such as Numpy, Pandas, Keras with sensitivity:0.9066, 
precision:0.8831, false negatives:14, ROC_AUC_SCORE:0.89, and accuracy:0.9625.

I have used the Kaggle competition dataset, and also I have generated some images using augmentation because the dataset is highly imbalanced. For the malignant class, there are 
only 64 unique patient id images out of 33126 images. I have trained the model using 1600 images and got sensitivity:0.9066, precision:0.8831, false negatives:14, 
ROC_AUC_SCORE:0.89, and accuracy:0.9625.
